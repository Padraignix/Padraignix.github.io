        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Essentially this is a wishlist of items I'd like to get completed in 2020 - or later years if I really want to start planning ahead. I started this blog as a way to stay accountable of my efforts by posting updates and ensuring that I keep myself on track. Now I'm taking this a step further and planning out certain efforts ahead of time while I work on them during any rapidly diminishing free time.

        <h2>CISM - ISACA</h2>
        <p>
          A few years ago I went through the <a href="https://www.isaca.org/credentialing/cisa"><font color="green">CISA</font></a> certification process. Now I'm challenging myself to get the <a href="https://www.isaca.org/credentialing/cism"><font color="green">CISM</font></a> certification. There are a few reasons as to "why" that I will try and cover through a series of posts.

          These articles will serve as a personal review and help reinforce the concepts covered within the four domains covered - trying to do an article per domain.

        <h2>CryptoPals</h2>
        <p>
          From the moment I stumbled on to <a href="https://cryptopals.com/"><font color="green">CryptoPals</font></a> I knew I wanted to go through the problem set. I decided to approach these challenges with a set purpose - to help solidify my Python coding skills as well offer me a chance to work with cryptographic algorithms directly where I may not have had an excuse to do so previously. I really want to take the opportunity to dig into the algorithms themselves and expand on my knowledge of weaknesses that these algorithms may have.
        </p>
        <p>
          The plan will be to approach each of the problem sets as a unit. I will do my best to write an article covering each problem set individually, focusing on any particular challenge or interesting aspects I ran into while solving the set. Additionally I plan on uploading my solutions to <a href="https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}"><font color="green">GitHub</font></a>.

        <h2>Emulator Development</h2>
        <p>
          This project is a revamp of a 2017 effort I started but never quite completed - a GameBoy emulator. I had originally managed to write a partially working GB emulator in C, however I did not quite sort out sprite issues to make it truly playable.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to tackle this projet with a few differences to how I attempted it years ago. Firstly, I want to take this opportunity to explore the Rust language rather than coding it in C once again. Rust was a language I was first introduced to in 2019 and after some background reading I decided I wanted to explore the language a but further. The emulator project was a perfect project to get dive head first into learning the language.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of starting off directly with a GB emulator I'm planning on approaching this effort in a more progressive manner. Since I do not have a proper background with the Rust language the plan is to start with a simpler Chip8 emulator. This will hopefully allow a more gradual introduction to the Rust language with a "simplified" emulator project that can be expanded to a full GB emulator.
